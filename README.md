# AAI_590-Capstone-Project
# Fashion Predictive Forecasting

## What question are you answering or what problem are you solving with your project? 
The primary question or problem being addressed by this project is how to improve predictive forecasting in the fashion industry. More specifically, the project aims to address the challenge of making products that consumers want to buy in a timely and adaptive manner, given the rapidly changing nature of consumer trends in fashion.
## Why is this project important or useful? 
This project is important and useful for several reasons:
The fashion industry is highly competitive, and companies that can accurately forecast and meet consumer demand are more likely to thrive.
Accurate forecasting can help reduce excess inventory and waste, leading to cost savings and sustainability benefits.
Consumer trust in a brand is heavily influenced by its ability to provide products that align with current trends, making accurate forecasting crucial for brand reputation.

## Who is the end user of your AI product/model? 
The end users of this product are mainly merchandising and design teams who are making early decisions on the direction of a product line.  These teams would benefit from the insights and recommendations generated by the predictive forecasting in order to help guide the overall design direction and help to identify sku-based forecasted quantities in order to make the best use of an Open-to-Buy (OTB) budget.

## What data will you be using in your project? Where does this data come from? If your project is meant to simulate a live AI product, where would the data come from in the live system? 
The project will use the Kaggle H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/overview).  This dataset contains historical sales data and various product attributes.  This can be paired with (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-review) in order to get some general social and sentiment analysis (the correlation between the datasets are not real but will make an attempt to align them)

## What is the ultimate goal of your project?  If you are answering a question, what is your (high-level) hypothesis? If you are solving a problem, what would the final product look like? 
The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a predictive forecasting solution for the fashion industry that leverages historical sales trends, social and sentiment analysis, and generative AI for design recommendations. The high-level hypothesis is that by integrating these diverse data sources and AI techniques, the fashion industry can make more informed decisions about product design, production, and marketing. The final product might include a software tool or system that provides real-time insights into current and future consumer trends, as well as design suggestions based on those trends. This tool would help fashion companies stay competitive, reduce waste, and enhance consumer trust in their brand.
